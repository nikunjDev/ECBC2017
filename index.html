              In accordance with section 14(p) of the Energy Conservation Act 2001 the purpose of the Energy
              Conservation Building Code (Code) is to provide minimum requirements for the energy-efficient
              design and construction of buildings. The Code also provides two additional sets of incremental
              requirements for buildings to achieve enhanced levels of energy efficiency that go beyond
              the minimum requirements.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
              The code is applicable to buildings or building complexes that have a connected load of 100 kW
                or greater or a contract demand of 120 kVA or greater and are intended to be used for
                commercial purposes.</p>

                <li>The interior lighting power allowance is the sum of the lighting power allowances for all

          <h4 id="9_1_1" class="wbp-title"><a href="">9.1.1 Scope </a></h4>
            <p>The Whole Building Performance Method is an alternative to the Prescriptive Method compliance
              path contained in <a href="4.html">§4</a> through <a href="7.html">§7</a> of this Code.
              It applies to all building types covered by the
              Code as mentioned in <a href="2.html#2_5">§2.5</a>.</p>

          <!-- 9.1.2 Compliance

          <h4 id="9_1_2" class="wbp-title"><a href="">9.1.2 Compliance</a></h4>
            <p>
                A building complies with the Code using the Whole Building Performance (WBP) Method, when the
                estimated EPI Ratio is equal to or less than 1, even though it may not comply with the specific
                provisions of the prescriptive requirements in <a href="4.html">§4</a> trough <a href="7.html">§7</a>.
                The mandatory requirements of <a href="4.html">§4</a>
                through <a href="7.html">§7</a> (<a href="4.html">§4.2</a>, <a href="5.html">§5.2</a>, <a href="6.html">§6.2</a>, and <a href="7.html">§7.2</a>) shall be met when using the WBP Method. </p>

          ================================================== -->
          <h4 id="9_1_3" class="wbp-title"><a href="">9.1.3 Annual Energy Use</a></h4>

            <p>Annual energy use for the purposes of the WBP Method shall be calculated in kilowatt-hours (kWh)
                of electricity use per year per unit area. Energy sources other than electricity that are used
                in the building shall be converted to kWh of electric energy at the rate of 0.75 kWh per
                megajoule.</p>
            <p>Note: The annual energy use calculation as per the Whole Building Performance Method is not a
                prediction of the actual energy use of the building once it gets operational. Actual energy
                performance of a building depends on a number of factors like weather, occupant behaviour,
                equipment performance and maintenance, among others, which are not covered by this Code.</p>

            <p>The WBP Method may be used for building permit applications that include less than the whole
                building; however, any design parameters that are not part of the building permit application
                shall be identical for both the Proposed Design and the Standard Design. Future improvements to

            <p> Projects may choose either option A or option B given below for modelling campus/district

                <b>Option A</b> The cooling source shall be modeled as purchased chilled water in both
                the Standard Design and Proposed Design. For the Standard Design, <a href="#Table9-2">Table 9-2</a>,
                shall be modified as follows:</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>For System Type C; purchased chilled water shall be modeled as the cooling source. </li>
                <li>System Types A and B shall be replaced with a two-pipe fan coil system
                    with purchased chilled water as the cooling source. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The chilled water/thermal energy consumption
                simulated by the software shall be converted to units of kWh and added to the overall building
                energy consumption. The following conversion factors shall be used to convert chilled
                water/thermal energy consumption to units of kWh. <br/>

            1 ton hour = 0.85 kWh <br/>
            1 MBtu = 1,000,000 Btu = 293 kWh<br/>

            <b>Option B</b><br/>
            The Standard Design shall be modeled as per <a href="#Table9-2">Table 9-2</a>. For the
                Proposed Design, model a virtual onsite chilled water plant with Chiller, Pumps and cooling
            towers modeled at minimum efficiency levels as per <a href="#9_4_2_7">§9.4.2.7</a> to <a href="#9_4_2_10">§9.4.2.10</a>. Airside/low side
                capacities shall be modeled as per design and the plant capacities shall be auto-sized by the
                software.
